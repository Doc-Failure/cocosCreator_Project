I created this project using CocosCreataor 1.9.0. The tool is very simple to use, if you are interested in a test project to understand how the tool works you can clone this repository. If you have any suggestions to give me, write them to me :) .
You can found CocosCreator here: http://www.cocos2d-x.org/creator .
 1 - To start the game install CocosCreator and open the game.
 2 - Go in the Scene directory and double click on the "Main" scene.
 3 - Press the Play Button
